**Weekly Report (10th August to 16th August) -**

***

**Aim** - Implement the spatial filter functions for the module.

**Things, I have done this week**
* Added EWKT support in geometry input field. 
* Added wkt data parsing using already exist postgis_Wkt class.
* Overwrote the admin_summary function to improve the admin view. 


**Code Cleaning**
* Removed dependency of nid_postgis_field.
* Removed dependency of repetitive selection of geometric node by setting the PostGIS field to already selected value. No need of it as dropdown.


**Things to do next week**
* GSoC documentation and code commenting.
* Prepare the final report with User Guide.
