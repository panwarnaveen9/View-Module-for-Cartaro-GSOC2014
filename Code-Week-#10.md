**Aim** - Implement the spatial filter functions for the module.

* Geometry validation by adding [ST_IsValid](http://postgis.refractions.net/documentation/manual-1.4/ST_IsValid.html) in where clause of query.
* Added more spatial relationship function to module like: ST_Crosses, ST_CoveredBy, ST_ContainsProperly.
