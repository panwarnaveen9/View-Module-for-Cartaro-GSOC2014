**Weekly Report (15th June to 21st June) -**

***

**Aim** - Implement the spatial relationship functions for the module.

**Things, I have done this week**

* Worked on available code for spatial queries in Cartaro.

* **New relational functionalities** -
  1. ST_Covers — Returns 1 (TRUE) if no point in Geometry B is outside Geometry A.
  2. ST_Equals — Returns true if the given geometries represent the same geometry. Directionality is ignored.
  3. ST_Touches — Returns TRUE if the geometries have at least one point in common, but their interiors do not intersect.
  4. ST_Within — Returns true if the geometry A is completely inside geometry B.
  5. ST_Overlaps — Returns TRUE if the Geometries share space, are of the same dimension, but are not completely contained by each other.

**Things to do next week**

* Mid Term Evaluations.
* Test and implement the relational functions.
