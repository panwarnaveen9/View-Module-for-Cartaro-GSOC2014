**Weekly Report (15th June to 21st June) -**

***

**Aim** - Implement the spatial relationship functions for the module.

**Things, I have done this week**

* Added new content type with geometric field in WKT(Well Known Text) format. 
* Worked on Views configuration UI.
* Customized the format(content/field) in Views.
* Configured and tested the different criteria under filter and sort of Views.
* Understood the different terminology of Views interface which are as follow
  * Display
  * Filter
  * Content versus Fields 
  * Pager 
  * Contextual filters
  * Exposed filters

**Mentor Suggestions**

* Most of spatial relationship operations required a second geometry B. Right now the PostGIS field only supports geometry B from contextual filters in Views.
* We need to implement a simple WKT field in the PostGIS configuration mask for a manual geometry B input as an alternative to the contextual filter.

**Things to do next week**

* Understand the Form API and query functions customization in Views. 
* Mid Term Evaluations.
* Test and implement the relational functions.
